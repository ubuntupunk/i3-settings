### Installation

### Place of configurations
```
i3 -> ~/.config/i3/
```
### Notes

1. I salvaged an old Lenova SL500 running AntiX (Debian based) from a friend after my main machine was water-damaged.
2. 
3. I setup an earlier version HackPi on Raspberry 3B+ during a level 9 storm in Cape Town. During a disaster, the only thing you may have, is a late model Raspberry Pi. Crucial to have a setup that will actually work on the Net.
